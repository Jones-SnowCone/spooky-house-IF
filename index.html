    <p>You are inside a relatively spooky house due to a dare you accepted from your friend. You were suppose to stay inside for as long as possible and to explore around the area lest you are called a "chicken".</p>
    
    <p>However, you swore you heard a swish of a door to the left of you...</p>
    
    <p>Then a loud shutter and rattling inside a cage on the floor in front of you, draped with a thick towel...</p>
    
    <p>And finally a squeaky 'erk' of faucets turning from upstairs.</p>
    
    <p id="decisions">You weigh your options and decide to:</p>
    
    <a href="endings/1.html" target="_self" id="1">Walk back out of the house and be made fun of as a "coward" (but a smart ones at that).</a><span id="a"> !(Sound Warning)!</span>
   <br />
    <a href="endings/2.html" target="_self" id="2">Take a peek at the cage and hope the animal inside is being well fed!</a><span id="b"> !(Sound Warning)!</span>
    <br />
    <a href="endings/3a.html" target="_self">Go upstairs to see what is happening there.</a>
    <br />
    <a href="endings/4.html" target="_self" id="3">Swing towards the left to see who is paying for the house to be slamming doors around.</a><span id="c"> !(Sound Warning)!</span>
