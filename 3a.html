    <h1>Up the Stairs</h1>
    <hr />

<p>The gentle creeks of the staircase as you walk up gives you quite a shiver. As the moans of the old wood let up when you took your last step onto the final flight of stairs, you start to hear some singing in a lit room to your left as well as running water. As you move towards the source of the noise and reach your hand at the knob of the room's door, a thought goes through your mind about this being a <span style="color: red">bad idea</span></p>

<p id="1">Though, considering the situation you are currently in, bad ideas are something you are accustomed to</p>

<p>Mulling over your options for a bit, you decide to:</p>

<p>Be a man (or woman/what-have-you (we are inclusive after all)) and investigate the room in spite of you intuition!</p><span>!(Sound Warning)!</span>
<br />
<p>Have yourself a cry</p><span>... and hopefully feel better. !(Sound Warning)!</span>
